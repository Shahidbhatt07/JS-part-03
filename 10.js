//AJAX -> Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
// BASIC THEORY

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and XML
//XMl is data format but we dont use it now. we use JSON nowadays

//Here we have to learn how to send HTTP request from browser(client) to server to create/update/send data
//HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
//browser(client) and server communicate with each other wiith the help of HTTP

// AJAX is
// is a set of "web development techniques" 
// using many web technologies on the "client-side "
// to create asynchronous web applications. 


// With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve 
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background) 
// without interfering with the display and 
// behaviour of the existing page

// We don't use data in XML format anymore. 
// we use JSON now. 


// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3.) axios (this is third party library)
